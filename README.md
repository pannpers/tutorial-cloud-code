# Create GKE Cluster

```
Running the following command:

gcloud container clusters create tutorial-cluster --zone="asia-northeast1-b" --machine-type="[object Object]" --num-nodes="3" --project="hosting-with-cloud-run"

Cluster "tutorial-cluster" is being created. This operation can take up to 5 minutes. You can use "Google Kubernetes Engine Explorer" tree-view to manage this cluster.

You can wait for the cluster creation to complete and auto-refresh the tree-view. If you wish not to wait, you can safely close this window without affecting the creation process.
```
